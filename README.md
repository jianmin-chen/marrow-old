## TODO

- [ ] Get backup (keypresses) and save working
- [ ] Get tabs to remain the same when user goes to next line
- [ ] `zz` to center, other commands you normally use in Vim (`dd`)
- [ ] Get tab system working, `;` and Ctrl+number to move between tabs
- [ ] Get line numbers working
- [ ] Get Git gutters working
- [ ] Get Wakatime integration working (should we write scripts in a different lang to do these things or...?)
- [ ] Get tree view similar to Vim's ":Ex" working, starting in the directory of the given directory or just the default directory if one isn't provided
- [ ] Be able to move around and open files through the tree view
- [ ] Get terminal emulator working
- [ ] Get multiple terminal system up and running
- [ ] Clean up, test out for a few weeks and add/remove features as needed
- [ ] Format on save (Prettier for web stuff, clang-format for C and C++, and Black for Python)
- [ ] Soft wrap choice
- [ ] Resizing sucks
- [ ] Fix paste to be faster (render first then color?)
